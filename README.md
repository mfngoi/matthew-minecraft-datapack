# matthew-minecraft-datapack
This is a personalized datapack that I created for a private server during the summer of 2020. It adds more progression into the game, allowing players to create sword
enchantments up to 
* Sharpness X
* Fire Aspect III
* Knockback III
* Looting V
* Sweeping Edge V

New tagged items are added into the game that are used when crafting higher level enchants.
The ender dragon drops Diamond Components Level 1. The Diamond Components used in drop down crafting within the radius of certain locations to create unique items. This gives
locations importance in the server and allows people to congregate near an area.

A shop system is also added into the game. Players can use Combat Coins earned from the arena to purchase unique items from interactable signs.
